Taxonomy Developer Extras is a Drupal module to supply a number of utility
features to the Taxonomy module to make development tasks just a little
easier.

The initial functions that will be made available will be the creation of
vocabularies from a nested array. The idea here is to provide a function that
would be used in a modules .install file to easily create a prepopulated 
vocabulary by calling a single function with a single array as its parameter.

Additional features would be a copy/paste export of a vocabulary that can be
added pasted into an update hook.

I suspect that these exist somewhere already but I my google-fu has failed me
to date. If anyone knows of it I would love to hear about it.
